        "grading": "Detailed Scoring Criteria:\n\nScene Score:\n\n- 0 point: The picture does not include a glass containing a mixture of milk and water. Any other scenario, regardless of whether laws of physics are represented accurately, does not meet the requirement.\n\n- 1 point: The picture contains some elements of the required scene. For example, there might be a glass and water, but no milk, or a glass with milk, but no water. Alternatively, the mixture could be there but not in a glass. The correctness of the depicted laws of physics does not influence the scene score.\n\n- 2 points: The picture accurately includes a glass with milk and water. Regardless of whether the laws of physics are depicted accurately, the scene requirement is fulfilled.\n\nPhysical Law Score:\n\n- 0 point: The picture portrays the law of physics inaccurately by showing milk and water as separate layers or suspensions in the glass after standing for a while, or if it shows any other inaccurate depection like milk or water defying gravity etc.\n\n- 1-2 points: The picture partially represents the law of physics: for example, there could be some minor discrepancies in how the milk dissolves into the water, such as small regions where the milk seems not to have mixed completely.\n\n-- 1 point: The depiction is largely incorrect. The milk and water only partially mixed, with large portions remaining separate.\n   \n-- 2 points: Most of the liquid is shown as a homogeneous mixture, but there are small discrepancies like slightly different color regions hinting partial mixing.\n\n- 3 points: The picture correctly shows a homogeneous mix of milk and water, accurately reflecting our understanding of physics that milk being soluble in water, mixes to form a uniform solution after standing for a while.",

        "grading": "Scoring Criteria:\n\nScene Score:\n\n- 0 point: The picture does not depict a glass of water and cola mixed liquid that has been standing for a while. \n- 1 point: The picture does depict a glass of some liquid but it's not clear that it is a mixture of water and cola. Whether the glass has been standing for a while must be discernible. The details of the liquid (texture, clarity, effervescence etc.) aren't correctly depicted.\n- 2 points: The picture accurately depicts a glass of water and cola mixed liquid that has been standing for a while. The details of the liquid such as color, texture, clarity etc. are accurately shown.\n\nPhysical Laws Score:\n\n- 0 point: The representation completely disregards the physical law of solubility. The picture shows an incorrect representation such as a layer of cola floating on top of the water etc. \n- 1-2 points: The picture shows the cola and water mixed but it is not a homogeneous solution. There could be inconsistencies in the texture, color etc. of the solution. The score range allows for varying degrees of inaccuracy - 1 point would be for significant inaccuracy and 2 points would be for minor inaccuracies.\n- 3 points: The picture accurately depicts the laws of physics pertaining to the solubility of cola in water. The liquid in the glass is a uniform, homogeneous mixture. \n\nThis scoring system covers the necessary criteria and allows for a range of accuracy, ensuring even minor discrepancies can be accounted for. It only considers the physical contents, accuracy of depiction and the laws of physics, not the aesthetics or quality of the picture.",
