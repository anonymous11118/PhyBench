Physical Laws Score:\n - If the key physical law (the absorption of yellow light by the blue dye) is not depicted at all in the picture, the score would be 0 point.\n - If the key physical law is depicted but with some inaccuracies (ex: some yellow light is shown passing through the blue dye, or the blue dye appears a different color after absorption) score would be between 1-2 points.
